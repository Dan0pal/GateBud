## 🧩 Project Description

### 🚨 Problem  
In airline catering operations, assembling meal trays for onboard service is a repetitive and time-sensitive process where even small mistakes — such as placing the wrong alcoholic beverage or forgetting an item — can lead to **rework, waste, and non-compliance with airline policies**.  

Each airline has **different rules** for serving and handling alcoholic beverages, making it difficult for employees to remember every specific policy while working under pressure.  
As a result, inconsistencies occur between trays, causing inefficiencies, product loss, and additional supervision costs for **gategroup**, one of the largest providers of inflight catering worldwide.

### 💡 Solution — *GateBud*  
**GateBud** is a **voice-activated AI assistant** designed to **guide and support employees** during the tray assembly process for airline catering.  
Powered by **Gemini AI**, it understands **voice commands and visual context** to provide real-time recommendations and error detection.  

GateBud helps employees:
- **Standardize decisions** regarding alcohol policies for each airline.  
- **Reduce product errors or missing items** on trays through intelligent visual and verbal feedback.  
- **Improve efficiency and speed**, allowing employees to assemble trays faster and with greater confidence.  
- **Ensure traceability and compliance**, logging each decision for quality and audit purposes.  

The assistant communicates naturally, allowing workers to keep both hands free while performing tasks — enhancing **safety, comfort, and accuracy** on the production line.
